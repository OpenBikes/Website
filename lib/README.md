# Routing

A path is a symbolic link between two points. A route is a list of clear directions to get from a point to another.

## Picking a bike up

    '''
    - Generate a path to pick up a bike.

    - The situation arguments has the shape

        situation = {
            'city': string,
            'departure': text or (lat, lon),
            'arrival': text or (lat, lon)
            'people': integer,
            'time': array of size 0 or 1
        }

    The time array's first element is always an epoch timestamp
    in integer format. It accounts for the number of milliseconds
    since the epoch moment. The second element can be a HH:mm
    string if the user wishes to leave at certain time and not
    now.

## Dropping a bike down


    '''
    - Generate a path to drop a bike.

    - The situation arguments has the shape

        situation = {
            'city': string,
            'departure': text or (lat, lon)
            'arrival': text or (lat, lon),
            'people': integer,
            'time': array of size 0 or 1
        }

    The time array's first element is always an epoch timestamp

    string if the user wishes to leave at certain time and not
    now.
    '''

## Doing a full trip


    '''
    With the time and the departure time, choose the shortest
    route that also will have bikes or spaces. The departure
    and arrival are two points. The candidates is a list
    of paths between the departure and the arrival sorted
    by distance. The target is to know if the searched bike
    station has to have bicycles or spaces. The mode is to
    know if the path to be generated by Valhalla is to be
    considered as a pedestrian or a bicycle path.
